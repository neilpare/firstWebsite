# firstWebsite
This is a very very noob first Website I'm building to learn about HTML/CSS/JS and Web Development in general, full of mistakes, full of bad practice :) stay out!

What I want to achieve here is educational only and has no value if your at the second step of Web development.

This is a step by step thingy, meaning some stuff I already know, some stuff is new, some stuff is re-learned from scratch to improve or learn good practice.

I don't even know why I'm writing this, if you're here you're really desperate XD
